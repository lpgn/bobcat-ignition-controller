# Bobcat Ignition Controller - TODO & Action Items

## **Immediate Next Steps - Action Plan**

### **Phase 1: Schematic Design (Week 1-2)**
- [ ] Create detailed schematic using KiCad or Altium Designer
- [ ] Component selection - specific part numbers from major suppliers
- [ ] Circuit simulation - SPICE models for critical analog circuits
- [ ] Design review - peer review of schematic before PCB layout
- [ ] BOM cost analysis - target <$100 per board in qty 10

### **Phase 2: PCB Layout (Week 3-4)**
- [ ] Component placement - optimize for EMI/thermal performance
- [ ] Routing strategy - separate analog/digital domains
- [ ] Power plane design - minimize noise coupling
- [ ] DRC compliance - design rule check for manufacturing
- [ ] 3D modeling - mechanical fit verification

### **Phase 3: Prototype & Testing (Week 5-8)**
- [ ] Board fabrication - 4-layer PCB with controlled impedance
- [ ] Component assembly - initial hand-soldering for prototype
- [ ] Bench testing - verify all circuits without engine
- [ ] Engine integration - real-world testing on Bobcat 743
- [ ] Calibration & tuning - optimize sensor readings

### **Phase 4: Documentation & Release (Week 9-12)**
- [ ] Assembly documentation - detailed build instructions
- [ ] Calibration procedures - step-by-step sensor setup
- [ ] Installation guide - mechanical and electrical installation
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide - common issues and solutions
- [ ] Open-source release - GitHub repository with full design files

## **Critical Questions for Next Review**

### **Design Decisions Needed:**
- [ ] External ADC vs ESP32 ADC? - Recommendation: ADS1115 for precision
- [ ] Single PCB vs modular? - Recommendation: Single PCB with removable sections
- [ ] Connector type? - Automotive IP67 vs standard headers
- [ ] Power input protection? - Fuse + TVS + reverse protection
- [ ] Enclosure strategy? - IP67 aluminum enclosure vs plastic

### **Sensor Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] Actual Bobcat 743 sensor resistance values - need field measurements
- [ ] Wiring harness compatibility - connector pinouts and wire colors
- [ ] Alternator W terminal availability - verify on target machine
- [ ] Glow plug controller integration - existing vs replacement
- [ ] Safety interlocks - oil pressure, coolant temperature limits

### **Regulatory Compliance:**
- [ ] EMI/EMC requirements - CISPR-25 automotive standard
- [ ] Safety certifications - UL, CE marking requirements
- [ ] Environmental compliance - RoHS, REACH directives
- [ ] Functional safety - ISO 26262 considerations for critical functions
