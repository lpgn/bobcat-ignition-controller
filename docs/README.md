# Documentation Index

Welcome to the Bobcat Ignition Controller documentation.

This safetyâ€‘critical ESP32 firmware controls ignition, glow plugs, starter, and lights for a Bobcat 743 (Kubota V1702-BA). All business logic is implemented in C++; the web UI is thin and only handles UI and HTTP requests.

## Standards and principles

- Logic location: All calculations, calibrations, validation, and state management in C++. JavaScript only for UI, basic validation, and fetch().
- Never use delay(): use millis() patterns.
- Manual validation: ElegantOTA uploads must be done with a visible browser (no headless) for verification.
